GAME RULES

The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
In each turn, a player rolls a dice as may times as he wishes. Each result
  gets added to his ROUND score
BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND scores get lost. After that, it's the next
  player's turn
The player can choose to 'HOLD', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL
  score. After that, it's the next player's turn
The first player to reach 100 point on GLOBAL score wins the game
